CPSC 481 Project - Clemson

This is the rails backend application for a mobile app developed in CPSC 4810. Classconnect allows a user to browse and subscribe to different courses. Courses have feeds of posts that can include different types of media and links. Courses can be subscribed to and posts can be created and deleted.

This rails app is simply the backend API for the iOS app which also includes a web service with all the same features as the app.
